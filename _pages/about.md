I (Chinese: 俞嘉翱)am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Sociology](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/socant/) at Northeastern University. My research interests primarily focus on how social relationships influence youth behavior and mental health. I aim to use computational methods, such as social network analysis, to examine these dynamics.
